      Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and
      publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by Tim
      Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his
      parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. <br />
      Following his first commercial video game release, ZZT (1991), the company
      became Epic MegaGames, Inc. in early 1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who is
      the company's vice president to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in
      1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic.Epic Games develops the
      Unreal Engine, a commercially available game engine which also powers
      their internally developed video games, such as Fortnite and the Unreal,
      Gears of War and Infinity Blade. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the
      "most successful videogame engine" by Guinness World Records.[4] Epic
      Games owns video game developers Chair Entertainment, Psyonix and
      Mediatonic, as well as cloud-based software developer Cloudgine, and
      operates eponymous sub-studios in Seattle, England, Berlin, Yokohama and
      Seoul. While Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder, Tencent acquired
      a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company
      in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a games as a
      service model. Following the release of the popular Fortnite Battle Royale
      in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand
      its Unreal Engine offerings, establish esport events around Fortnite, and
      launch the Epic Games Store. As of April 2021, the company has a US$28.7
      billion equity valuation. On August 13, 2020, Epic released a version of
      Fortnite that included a permanent discount on V-bucks across all
      platforms, but for those on iOS and Android devices, only if they
      purchased directly through Epic, bypassing Apple and Google's storefronts.
      Both Apple and Google immediately delisted the game for violating the
      storefronts' terms of service by including their own storefront, which led
      Epic to file lawsuits against both companies the same day, accusing them
      of antitrust behavior in how they operate their app stores.[5]
